# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Using data from the UCI website, used machine learning algorithms to classify data. Specifically, used Support Vector Machines as well as K-NearestNeighbors to detect whether a breast cancer cell is malignant or benign. Also, compared which classification algorithm produced better accuracy.
This project was based off Udemy course:
Applied Machine Learning for Healthcare.

I am still working on issues in regards to code,
But fully went through the section in regards to
classifying data of breast cancer cells.
