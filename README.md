# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Using data from the UCI website, used machine learning algorithms to classify data. Specifically, used Support Vector Machines as well as K-NearestNeighbors to detect whether a breast cancer cell is malignant or benign. Also, we used cross-validation to see which classification algorithm produced better accuracy.
